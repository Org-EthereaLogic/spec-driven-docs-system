# Document Specifications

This directory contains specification files generated by `/doc-plan`. Specifications define the requirements, structure, and content outline for documents before they are generated.

## Directory Structure

```
specs/docs/
├── README.md           # This file
├── [slug]-spec.md      # Standalone document specs
└── [suite-id]/         # Suite-organized specs
    └── [slug]-spec.md
```

## Creating Specifications

Use `/doc-plan` to create specifications:

```
/doc-plan "API Reference Guide" --type api
/doc-plan "System Architecture" --type design --suite my-project
/doc-plan "Getting Started Guide" --type manual --output specs/docs/custom-path.md
```

## Specification Lifecycle

1. **Draft**: Created by `/doc-plan`, ready for review
2. **Approved**: Reviewed and ready for document generation
3. **Generated**: Document created via `/doc-write`

## Generating Documents from Specs

```
/doc-write specs/docs/api-reference-spec.md
/doc-write specs/docs/my-project/architecture-spec.md --output docs/design/
```

## Specification Format

Each spec file contains:
- **Metadata**: Type, created date, status, suite association
- **Document Details**: Title, description, target audience, prerequisites
- **Content Outline**: Sections with requirements and source references
- **Code Examples Required**: What examples to include
- **Output Configuration**: Where to save the generated document

## User Story Best Practices

When creating specifications with `/doc-plan`, consider including user stories to clarify purpose and audience.

### User Story Format

```text
As a [role],
I want [capability],
So that [benefit].
```

### Examples

**API Documentation:**

```text
As a backend developer,
I want complete API endpoint documentation with request/response examples,
So that I can integrate the service without guessing parameter formats.
```

**Design Document:**

```text
As a system architect,
I want to understand the trade-offs between sync and async processing,
So that I can make informed decisions about system design.
```

**User Manual:**

```text
As a new user,
I want step-by-step setup instructions with expected outcomes,
So that I can start using the product without getting stuck.
```

### Including in Specifications

Add user stories to the "Target Audience" or "Requirements" section of your spec:

```markdown
## Target Audience

**Primary:** Backend developers integrating our API

**User Story:**
As a backend developer,
I want complete endpoint documentation,
So that I can implement integrations quickly and correctly.
```

This helps `/doc-write` generate content with the right level of detail and examples.
